Build & install instructions
============================

These are build & install instructions for Dust Racing 2D.

Source code
===========

The source tree includes source code for the track editor and the game itself.

The code is "documented" with Doxygen tags.

The source tree layout:

    src/game/          : Source files for the game.
    src/game/MiniCore/ : Graphics and physics engine.
    src/game/MTFH/     : Menu Toolkit From Hell.
    src/game/STFH/     : Sound Toolkit From Hell.
    src/editor/        : Source files for the track editor.
    src/common/        : Shared files between the editor and the game.
    src/images/        : Some SVG-images used as the source for final images.

Data directory structure:

    data/              : Data mapping and configuration files.
    data/fonts/        : Font used by the game.
    data/icons/        : Icon files for game and editor.
    data/images/       : Image files and textures loaded by the game.
    data/levels/       : Level data.
    data/models/       : 3D models.
    data/sounds/       : Sound files.
    data/translations/ : Released Qt translation files.

Other:

    packaging/windows/ : NSIS packaging for Windows.

Build systems
=============

The "official" build system for Linux is CMake.

Toolchains
==========

GCC/MinGW and Clang are the only "officially" supported toolchains on Linux.

Windows builds are done in a Docker container with MXE (http://mxe.cc). The build script
also generates automatically an NSIS Windows installer and a ZIP-archive.

See scripts/build-windows-nsis and scripts/build-windows-nsis-packaging-helper.

Building the project with Microsoft Visual C++ also works, but no automatic
packaging/deployment currently exist. The runtime files (data/, Qt, OpenAL..) must be
manually copied in place. See more detailed instructions below.

Build dependencies
==================

Currently the build depends on Qt, libopenal and libvorbisfile.
On Linux pkg-config is required.

Building in the command line on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
==================================================================

Development build (the game can be run without installing anything):
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Install Qt6 (>= 6.4) development files and other build tools:

`$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libqt6uitools6 linguist-qt6 qt6-base-dev qt6-l10n-tools qt6-tools-dev-tools qt6-tools-private-dev libopenal-dev libvorbis-dev`

  (Qt packaging might change between Ubuntu releases)

2) Go to the source directory and run:

`$ mkdir build && cd build`

`$ cmake ..`

`$ make`

This will build the editor and the game binaries.

Run the game:

`$ ./dustrac-game`

Optionally run the track editor:

`$ ./dustrac-editor`

Run unit tests:

`$ ctest`

Release build (in this example game installs under /usr):
--------------------------------------------------------

`$ mkdir build && cd build`

`$ cmake .. -DReleaseBuild=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr`

`$ make`

This will build the editor and the game binaries.

Install the binaries and data files:

`$ sudo make install`

This installs also the desktop files so Dust Racing 2D
should appear in your application menu.

Cross-compiling for Windows in Docker with MXE on Linux
=======================================================

1) Install Docker

2) `$ ./scripts/build-windows-installer`

CPack
=====

Dust Racing 2D has a support for CPack. It's not complete, but can be used to generate
e.g. Debian packages.

After a successful build with ReleaseBuild=ON run CPack:

`$ cpack -G DEB`

This will generate a Debian package.

Building with Microsoft Visual C++ (OUTDATED)
=============================================

The project has been successfully compiled and executed with MSVC with the following setup:

* Windows 8.1 Pro
* Windows SDK for Windows 8.1
* CMake 3.0
* Qt 5.3 32-bit SDK for MSVC
* MS Visual Studio 2013 for Desktop Windows

1) Download and build Vorbis libraries and OpenAL Soft with the same toolchain

2) Open the top-level CMakeLists.txt in Qt Creator, configure and build

3) Copy the runtime files, like OpenAL DLL, to the same directory with the game binary

Jenkins CI
==========

Jenkinsfile includes pipelines configuration for Jenkins CI.

For packagers
=============

The binaries only need to find the data dir that includes
all the runtime data. This can be set in the main CMakeLists.txt
and is given to the game via -DDATA_PATH.

The release build should be used when packaging (give
-DReleaseBuild=ON to cmake).

Currently the data files install to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/DustRacing
and the binaries install to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin.

Among the data files there are also fonts that are installed by default;
in case they are available in the system, it is possible to not ship
any font by giving -DSystemFonts=ON to cmake.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX usually defaults to /usr/local and
can be changed by giving, for example, -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr to cmake.
